    <p>I created this site to help everyone find the 2016 presidential debates in one spot.</p>
    <p>We all have the right &amp; responsibility to be informed about our candidates.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, many networks that air the debates make it difficult to watch a debate after it was aired.</p>
    <p>I will update as debates are aired, and I am able to find them online.</p>
    <p>If you find an issue or broken video, please let me know via the "Bug" button below!</p>
