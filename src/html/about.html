    <p>I created this site to help everyone find the 2016 presidential debates in one spot.</p>
    <p>We have the right &amp; responsibility to be informed about the candidates, and I believe that networks should be legally required to back log the recordings online.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, this is not the case we must rely on user uploaded videos and searching across multiple sites.</p>
    <p>I will do my best to keep up with the debates, and maintain good links. But if you happen accross a broken link, or better video, please let me know via the "Bug" icon below!</p>
